          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><span class="hl">#1 contributor to TI's radar algorithms Git repository</span> that maintains proprietary solutions for various end-to-end applications. <span class="hl">The processing chains he built are featured in TI’s SDKs as out-of-the-box demos</span>, the <span class="hl">bit-exact algorithm frameworks he built in Matlab and C</span> became foundational to the Radar R&D team, and his solutions are being adopted by numerous customers as a reference design. Many of his works are also awarded at the TI internal venues (worldwide).</li>
            <li>He is currently <span class="hl">developing advanced multi-target tracking algorithms</span> for next-generation ADAS applications. Developed a novel <span class="hl">ego-pose estimation algorithm with odometer, IMU, and radar fusion (Kalman-based)</span>, and a <span class="hl">product-level ADAS tracker</span> (with a novel point-to-track association, extended/cubature Kalman filter (EKF/CKF) for non-linear filtering, and interactive multiple models (IMM) techniques), successfully validated with <span class="hl">real TI automotive radar data (AWR2944)</span>. The algorithms he is building became the foundational modules in the reference designs for TI’s automotive radar SoCs.</li>
            <li>As the algorithm owner of <span class="hl">TI’s next-generation low-power mmWave radar SoC xWRL6844</span>, he invented a novel automotive intrusion detection algorithm (<span class="hl">US Patent</span>) to solve the challenging false alarm issues fundamentally and developed a novel ML-based in-cabin occupancy detection algorithm (<span class="hl">US Patent</span>) targeting seat belt reminder use cases. He owned the entire algorithm development, <span class="hl">real-time on-device implementation</span>, and bit-matched validation frameworks (<span class="hl">featured at CES’25</span>).</li>
            <li>Developed comprehensive GUI-based toolsets in Matlab to enable robust data capturing and visualization for multiple use cases. Those toolsets that allow <span class="hl">capturing synchronized data (zero frame drops) from different sensors (radar, camera, IMU/GPS, odometer)</span> became de facto tools across the Radar R&D and were shared with many customers across the globe.</li>
            <li>Developed a comprehensive <span class="hl">classifier toolset package</span> (for object classification) to enable customers to streamline the radar data acquisition and annotation process, train new classifier models, and <span class="hl">deploy these models to the TI mmWave devices</span>.</li>
            <li>Mentored >20 new hires, interns, and colleagues to get them involved in the radar algorithms development process on day one. <span class="hl">Collaborated with Mathworks to help them add the support package for TI mmWave radar Sensors in Matlab</span>. Involved in >100 customer calls (online and on-site) to solve their challenging algorithm and implementation-related issues.</li>
            <li>Mentorship in university research projects (with Stanford, MSU, UT/Dallas) to develop novel solutions in radar perception. Consulted as <span class="hl">a go-to person for radar algorithms and real-time implementation topics</span>. Cross-collaboration with business units (e.g., Processors, EdgeAI Studio) and hardware/software designers to create innovative and impactful radar solutions.</li>

            <li>Assessing the algorithm tradeoffs to <span class="hl">improve the efficiency for real-time implementation on the SoCs</span> (with runtime memory/computation constraints), <span class="hl">he owned the real-time implementation (in C) of various radar signal processing and ML algorithms</span> on ARM Cortex R4F/M4F, C674x/C66x DSPs, and HWA IPs with production quality (well-documented).</li>
            <li>As the algorithm owner of <span class="hl">TI’s first low-power radar SoC xWRL6432</span> (involved in the entire lifecycle from kick-off to product launch), he fathered a novel (<span class="hl">US Patent</span>) <span class="hl">edge-AI project (deep-learning-based multi-target classification)</span>, including design, implementation, and finally, productization (<span class="hl">released in SDK)</span>. Achieved 97% target classification accuracy with only 40ms processing time (<span class="hl">highly optimized for xWRL6432 architecture – M4F@160MHz, 1MB RAM</span>) for five simultaneous tracks with low power (<100mW). The comprehensive framework he built includes in-house data capturing/labeling tools, <span class="hl">fully automated deep-learning workflows</span>, and GUI tools to visualize the real-time demo. This reference design implementation became the baseline for the following edge-AI offerings of TI’s mmWave radar device family (gesture recognition, etc.).</li>
            <li>Developed and implemented a power-optimized (meeting the stringent power consumption of <2mW) end-to-end motion/presence detection algorithm that best fits the xWRL6432 architecture. <span class="hl">The processing chain he built had been adopted to the MMWAVE-L-SDK as an out-of-the-box demo</span>. The production quality algorithms and testbench frameworks he built in Matlab (bit-exact models of real-time implementation) have been directly shared by many customers worldwide.</li>
            <li>Involved in the 3D people counting and tracking reference design development (the end-to-end detection and target tracking modules) on IWR6843. Invented a novel fine motion detection/localization algorithm (<span class="hl">US Patent</span>) to fundamentally solve the static people detection issue in highly cluttered environments. He <span class="hl">implemented the algorithm on IWR6843 in real-time (in C) and demonstrated significantly enhanced performance</span> (90% counting accuracy for six people) compared to the previous results (60% accuracy). This implementation has been released on TI.com and has played a significant role in many customer success stories (e.g., <span class="hl">based on this reference design, Lumi won the best smart home device at CES’23</span>).</li>
